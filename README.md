Scope:
------

The scope of this project is to create a MATLAB toolbox to facilitate
the polytopic overapproximation of the matrix exponential. In particular
we introduce methods that allow to overapproximate the range of functions
such as 
  f0(t) = expm(A*t) where A is an n-square matrix and t in [0,T]
  f1(t) = integral of f1(y) from 0 to t (dy) for t in [0,T]


Contents:
---------

All functions starting with zz_* are subroutines
All scripts starting with zt_* are tests
