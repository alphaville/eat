h1. e<sup>At</sup>  overapproximation library for MATLAB


h3. Project Name:

e<sup>at</sup> (version 0.0)


h3. Author:

Pantelis Sopasakis  ( "alphaville@github.com":https://github.com/alphaville )


h3. Scope:

The scope of this project is to create a MATLAB toolbox to facilitate the polytopic overapproximation of the matrix exponential. In particular
we introduce methods that allow to overapproximate the range of functions such as 
  
# f0(t) = expm(A*t) where A is an n-square matrix and t in [0,T]
# f1(t) = integral of f0(y) from 0 to t (dy) for t in [0,T]


h3. Contents:

All functions starting with zz_* are subroutines
All scripts starting with zt_* are tests


h3. Documentation:
