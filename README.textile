h1. e<sup>At</sup>  overapproximation library for MATLAB


h3. Project Name:

e<sup>at</sup> (version 0.0)


h3. Author:

Pantelis Sopasakis  ( "alphaville@github.com":https://github.com/alphaville )


h3. Scope:

The scope of this project is to create a MATLAB toolbox to facilitate the polytopic overapproximation of the matrix exponential. In particular
we introduce methods that allow to overapproximate the range of functions such as 
  
# $f0(t) = \exp(At)$ where $A$ is an $n\times n$  matrix and $t \in [0,T]$
# $f_1(t) = \int_0^t f_0(y) {\rm d}y$ for $t \in [0,T]$


h3. Contents:

All functions starting with <code>zz_*</code> are subroutines
All scripts starting with <code>zt_*</code> are tests


h3. Documentation:

Coming soon
